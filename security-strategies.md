# Security Strategies
## What to aim for
### Asset Inventory
### Software Reproducibility
- Affects Patching and Vulnerability Management
### Infrastructure Reproducibility
- Affects Immutability
- Ability to recover from disaster
### SDLC Maturity
- Affects Supply Chain
- Requires a Software Dependency Map
### Control pressure index
- Requires testing
- Awareness of defense in depth
- Emphasis on modelling real attacks
## How
### Resource contrains are a truism
- Never enough time, budget, capability
### Figure out A grade vs Pass
- Avoid to try and do everything brilliantly and  fail in unpredictable ways
- Avoid to realise limitations and spread everything too thinly
### Identify organisational leverage
- Platforms
  - Embed security in small number of highly opinionated platforms
    - IAM
    - API Infrastructure
    - Collaboration Technologies
    - Developer tooling
- Processes
  - SDLC
  - SRE
  - Incident Learning
  - Continuous Control Monitoring
- Culture
  - Amplify factors that influence security risk management
  - Psychological safety

## What to care about
### Economies of scale
### Shared Fate
### Healthy Competition
### Software Defined
### Simplicity
### Sustainability
### Increased deployment velocity
### Accelerated feedback loops
## Manage Demand
### Decrease demand by adjusting risk appetite
- Refocus on what is important
- Tighten definition of what is critical
### Eliminate risk to decrease demand
- Remove services, products, technologies
- Consolidate supply chains
## Manage Supply
### Increase resources
### Increase efficiency
- Scale better
- Increase training
- Implement tools and automation
- Embed security to raise the baseline
## Where to prioritise
### Most critical systems
### Systems being built or upgraded
### Reduce everything else by...
- Preventative maintenance
- Because assets become more critical
- Reduce the cost of control
