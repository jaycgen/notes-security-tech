# Security Training and Awareness
## Computer Based Training
### Consider valid push back
- Some compliance needs are not as rigid as expected
- Consider adjusting scope, appeal to auditors to satisfy the spirit if not the letter of outdated rules
- Consider reducing who has to do this if people have alternative professional certification or codes of conduct
### Pre-test
- Provide opportunity to pre-test and prove knowledge current before re-training
### Certify don't quiz
- Consider enabling people to certify understanding without convoluted test questions
## Ambient Controls (Solutions Not Just Policies)
### Implement ambient controls so significant training isnt needed
### Ask what failure exists such that training/policy is needed
### Example - implement multi party approval vs training and testing all employees on BEC as (only) control
## Explain the purpose of controls
### Explainability
- Be informative, empathetic and sympathetic
- Give rationale and context
- Provide mechanism to get help
### Escalation Path
- Enable people to feel active part of control environment
- Invite concerns and learn about underlying external factors
### Educate with Incidents
- Explain rationale with real impactful stories
### Thank People
- Be grateful for end user support
- Position controls as advantageous
- Shift users from victims to willing heroes
### Focus on New People
- Enable help desks and support teams to explain controls with case studies
- Give a fast path to security team to explain
### Day 100 vs Day 1
